Twitter-Crawl
=============

A Simple Crawler for twitter
Built in Qt and using its browser, its asks you to login using some id and one you can start to crawl using the cookies received for that account.
The settings file and the cookie files can be geneated so as to run the crawler even in non GUI mode.
Its starts from a user and stores its data and then proceeds in a BFS manner to the adjacent nodes in his network and thus continues crawling.
